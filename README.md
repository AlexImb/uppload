# Uppload

Uppload is a better JavaScript file uploader. Inspired by [Uploadcare](https://github.com/uploadcare/uploadcare-widget)'s widget, but highly customizable with an open API.

## Usage

Import Uppload to your project:

```bash
yarn add uppload
```

And then import it to your project:

```js
import Uppload from "uppload";
```

You can also `require` it in your project since it ships as UMD, or use it from one of the CDNs below:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/uppload/dist/uppload.min.js"></script> <!-- unpkg -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/uppload/dist/uppload.min.js"></script> <!-- jsDelivr -->
```

Create a new Uppload object with sample configuration:

```js
const profilePicture = new Uppload({

	// Default file value, useful for empty-state images
	value: "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/17.jpg",

	// Change the values of these elements with the file URL
	// Sets `value` for inputs and `src` for images
	bind: ["#profilePicInput", "#profilePicImage"],

	// Open the modal on clicking this button
	call: ["#upploadBtn"],

	// Function to upload the file to your server
	// Use either this or `endpoint` with URL
	onUpload: file => {
		return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
			fetch("https://example.com/upload", {
				method: "POST",
				body: file
			})
				.then(response => response.json())
				.then(json => {
					let url = json.url;
					resolve(url);
				})
				.catch(error => reject(error));
		});
	}

});
```

### Configutation

You can pass the following properties in the constructor:

| Property | Default | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | `""` | String | Default value of the file, useful for image placeholders |
| `bind` | `["[data-uppload-value]"]` | Array | Selectors for elements that need the uploaded file URL |
| `call` | `["[data-uppload-button]"]` | Array | Selectors for elements that open the modal on click |
| `onUpload` | `null` | Function | Function to upload file (returns promise with file URL) |
| `endpoint` | `""` | String | Endpoint to upload file using fetch POST |
| `services` | `["upload", "camera"]` | Array | List of upload services to show |

### Properties

You can use availavle properties to get information about the state of Uppload:

```js
const profilePicture = new Uppload();
console.log(profilePicture.isOpen); // Returns true or false
```

| Property | Default | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `isOpen` | `false` | Boolean | Returns whether the modal is currently open |
| `value` | `null` | String | Returns the URL of the uploaded file |
| `currentPage` | `upload` | String | Returns the current page from navbar |
| `modalElement` | [DOM Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) | Object | Returns the modal HTML DOM element |
| `backgroundElement` | [DOM Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) | Object | Returns the background HTML DOM element |

### Events

For reactive frameworks, it doesn't make sense to use the native Uppload `bind` property. Instead, you can watch the `Uppload.value` and build around that URL value. Alternately, you can also listen to events, like this (currently only supported by IE11+):

```js
const profilePicture = new Uppload();
profilePicture.addEventListener("fileUploaded", fileURL => {
	console.log(fileURL); // Logs the uploaded file's URL
});
```

| Event | Dispatched when | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `fileUploaded` | A new file is uploaded | `String` File URL |
| `fileError` | A error ocurred in uploading the file | Server's response |
| `modalOpened` | Model was opened | `undefined` |
| `modalClosed` | Model was closed | `undefined` |
| `pageChanged` | User navigated to this uploading service | `String` Service ID |

You can also programatically call these functions:

```js
const profilePicture = new Uppload();
profilePicture.openModal(); // Opens the modal
```

| Function | Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `openModal()` | None | Opens the modal |
| `closeModal()` | None | Closes the modal |
| `updateValue(param)` | `String` URL | Make this URL the post-uploading value |
| `changePage(param)` | `String` Service ID | Navigate to this uploading service |
| `uploadFile(param)` | `Blob` File | Upload this file to the server |

### Customization

You can customize the widget using CSS to overwrite properties. The following classes are used by Uppload:

| Selector | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.uppload-modal` | Main white modal |
| `.uppload-bg` | Translucent background |
| `.uppload-bg::after` | Cross (Ã—) button on the top-right |
| `.uppload-modal aside` | Left navbar |
| `.uppload-modal section` | Main content inside the modal |
| `.uppload-branding` | Small "Powered by Uppload" on the bottom-left |
| `.uppload-(modal/bg).fadeIn` | Fade in animation on open (400ms) |
| `.uppload-(modal/bg).fadeOut` | Fade out animation on close (400ms) |
| `.uppload-modal .primary-button` | "Upload" or "Import" call-to-action button |
| `.uppload-modal #dropzoneElt` | Dashed "drag-and-drop here" area |

Uppload also adds some classes to your elements that it interacts with:

| Selector | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.uppload-initialized` | Default value of file was set |
| `.uppload-updated` | New file was uploaded and set |

### Server-side implementation

Uppload does **not** provide the server side implementation of handling the files, but the way files are uploaded is identical to simple file upload forms like this:

```html
<form action="/upload_endpoint" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
	<input type="file" name="file" />
</form>
```

You can also use any of the following Dropzone starter templates with Uppload:

- [ASP.NET](http://venkatbaggu.com/file-upload-in-asp-net-mvc-using-dropzone-js-and-html5/)
