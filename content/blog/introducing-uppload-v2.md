# An even better file uploader for the web

In April 2018, I made the first commit to Uppload ([56bd930](https://github.com/elninotech/uppload/commit/56bd9307a020c692ed1383f0f4731690c00d90c9)) and pitched it as an idea to [Michael](/@michael), the founder of El Ni√±o, to fund the development of an open-source JavaScript file uploader, something that the web desperately needed.
